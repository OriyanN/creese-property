The extent of the implied guarantees depends on whether You are a ‘consumer’ of goods or services within the meaning of that term pursuant to the Australian Consumer Law as amended.

However, if the goods or services are subject to a non-excludable guarantee implied by the Australian Consumer Law and the goods or services are not ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, then pursuant to section 64A of the Australian Consumer Law, We limit Our liability for breach of any such non-excludable guarantee implied by the Australian Consumer Law (other than a guarantee implied by sections 51, 52 or 53 of the Australian Consumer Law) or expressly given by Us to You, in respect of each of the goods and services, to one or more of the following:
